                <h4><u>The Contract</u></h4>
                </br>
                <p>The contract is open source and visible here on <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0xce93f9827813761665ce348e33768cb1875a9704" target="_blank"><u>BSCScan</u></a>. Just as with all of "<a href="https://t.me/TheRealDeveloper" target="_blank"><u>The Developers</u></a>" projects, the contract is rug free and immutable, meaning there are no functions that the dev can use to drain or change the contract operations. The probability of the BNB Miner contract draining is highly unlikely due to our 3% maximum daily return and considering that many users are compounding their daily returns for larger future profits.
                </p>
                </br>
                <h4><u>Strategies & Additional Information:</u></h4>
                </br>
                <p>BNB Miner is for users who want long term profits and sustainability. It is not for people who want instant profits that ultimately Rekt others.</p>
                
                <p>BNB Miner is not to be confused with farms. Miners are not bought, they're hired and therefore can not be sold. Once miners are hired they work for you indefinitely, providing you with an unlimited amount of BNB at a starting rate of 3% daily.</p>

                <p>Our algorithm allows every participant to profit handsomely, no mater their strategy but it will not allow any single participant to have an unfair advantage over other participants. It's truly a beautiful thing!</p>
                
                <p>While the BNB Miner algorithm makes sure that all participants receive their fair share of rewards, it also favors it's most supportive participants through it's compounding option AKA "Hire More Miners".</p>

                <p>Strategies are personal,  you either strictly compound AKA "Hire More Miners", strictly pocket BNB or you do a healthy combination of both. In our opinion the best strategy is to compound as often as profitable, considering transaction gas. Once you're happy with your daily, weekly or monthly results, take profits as often as you see fit and simply continue compounding the rest.</p>

                 <p>Keep in mind that the 3% is not completely constant, it will vary slightly based on a combination of factors, including your personal hiring, pocketing, compounding habits and the habits of the community as a whole. Your personal habits hold much more weight in regards to your overal personal returns. Also remember, just as that number can decrease it also increases based on a combination of those same habits.</p>

                 <p>After hiring any number of miners, you will begin to see returns very close to the advertised 3% daily, this number will rise and/or fall based on the factors explained above. We will not attempt to share any exact numbers because it's a little too complicated but IOHO it's one of the most beautiful and fair systems available in the cryptocurrency space. BNB Miner is complete and 100% automated DeFi, no developer interaction is necessary to continue operating as intended.</p>
                 </br>
                 <h4><u>How To Mine BNB With BNB Miner</u></h4>
                </br>
                <p>Hire Miners > Miners Find BNB > Compound > Withdraw > Profit!</p>
                </br>
                <p>Step 1. Hire Miners using BNB.
                </p><p>Step 2. Your miners will start digging, placing the BNB they find into your barrel. You can compound AKA "Hire More Miners" using the BNB in your barrel to increases your BNB mining production rate.
                </p><p>Step 3. Alternatively, you can pocket the BNB in your barrel and your miners will begin filling your barrel again.
                </p>
                <p>Miners will continue filling your barrel with BNB non stop. A 24hr timer has been added for your convience, no need to have loose BNB sitting around too long doing nothing. You can "Hire More Miners" or pocket your BNB at any time but it's recommended to do so at least once every 24 hours.</p>
                </br>
                <h4><u>Fees:</u></h4>
                </br>
                <p>The only fee that users personally incur is their transaction gas fees. A 5% development fee is paid to the developer but this fee is not paid by you as a user,  this fee is paid to the developer by the contract as a whole.</p>
